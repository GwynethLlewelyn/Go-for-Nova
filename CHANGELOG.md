## Version 0.3.1

- Bumping the version because something went wrong with the upload

## Version 0.3.0

- Major rewriting of the code base, mostly thanks to the generous work provided by @jfieber and @seripap. Thanks guys!
- LSP interfacing with `gopls` now works! But don't expect miracles, we haven't still figured out all of it. Use `brew install gopls`.
- A few extension preferences were added by @jfieber (namely, turning LSP on and off, etc.); also, for development purposes, `gopls` will write some (cryptic) logs under `/tmp/gopls.log`
- Added more references to licenses; we are now including open-source code from Microsoft (I never though I'd ever write this in my lifetime! ðŸ˜³ðŸ¤“)
- Added more blahblahblah to the [README.md](README.md) (and a few markdown tricks!)
- New logo (ok, this is trivial, but I'm trying to keep up with Panic's re-styling! ðŸ˜…)
- To-do: figure out why `gopls` sends raw Markdown that Nova doesn't seem to understand
- To-do: understand why the extension crashes so often (at least in dev mode); it's possible that some cleanup code is missing and/or broken
- Tested under Nova 4.3

## Version 0.2.1

- Small JSON change from 'vendor' to 'organization' according to the new specs for the Nova Beta 1.0b18 (195066)
- Tried to add `gopls` again, but couldn't

## Version 0.2.0

- Added gazillions of changes, based on several different templates and the manuals of a competitor editor which uses similar syntax (which was originally based on the templates for Coda!)
- While this produces slightly better matching, there are tons of rules that never get activated but I don't know why
- Added a Smarty-like parser for Go Templates (it's basically the same concept with some tiny, Go-specific changes)
- Added some test files, please ignore them, they're not meant to be 'working code' (nor even valid one)
- Had to remove `gopls` because it's too big! You can download it from https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls

## Version 0.1.6 (never released)

- With the new Nova Beta update to 1.0b17 (Build 190148) it looks like the executable for `gopls` lost its executable flag; if that did make a difference or not is beyond me, but I recompiled `gopls` again, with newer libraries.
- When clicking on the syntax inspector button (at the bottom of each pane, the tiny 'target' icon which is to the left of the 'current symbol'), now 'something' happens when randomly clicking on Go code (i.e. there is a modal popup box that shows some information). If that's the desired behaviour or not... I have no idea.

## Version 0.1.5

- Make `.mod` files (e.g. `go.mod`) be part of the extensions, or else they will be seen as music files

## Version 0.1.4

Cleaning up the logs when instance is deactivated.

## Version 0.1.3

- Bumped version again
- Some more experiments on the test file `basictest.go`

## Version 0.1.2

- Slight bug on `main.js` (missing bracket)

## Version 0.1.1

- Version 0.1.0 was successfully uploaded to the Extensions Library!!
- Go LSP seems not to be working at all
- Lots of errors in syntax highlighting (e.g. variable declaration)

## Version 0.1.0

- After checking the many XML files, I found three minor bugs, and now the syntax highlighting not only works, but it shows up as a 'valid' language on all the places that it ought to show up!
- Apparently, you cannot have any images under the `Images/` folder, or uploading to the Extension Library does _not_ work
- Still working to fix the connection to the Go LPS (it's not being launched right now, but I have some ideas to fix it...)

## Version 0.0.2

- Syntax definition XML based on Nova JavaScript, using definitions from the old Coda 2 Go mode
- Tried to add Go LPS support
- Added the logo and a few things

## Version 0.0.1

Initial release â€” based on the original Coda 2 Go mode
