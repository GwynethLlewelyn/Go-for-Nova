## Version 0.1.3

- Bumped version again
- Some more experiments on the test file `basictest.go`

## Version 0.1.2

- Slight bug on `main.js` (missing bracket)

## Version 0.1.1

- Version 0.1.0 was successfully uploaded to the Extensions Library!!
- Go LSP seems not to be working at all
- Lots of errors in syntax highlighting (e.g. variable declaration)

## Version 0.1.0

- After checking the many XML files, I found three minor bugs, and now the syntax highlighting not only works, but it shows up as a 'valid' language on all the places that it ought to show up!
- Apparently, you cannot have any images under the `Images/` folder, or uploading to the Extension Library does _not_ work
- Still working to fix the connection to the Go LPS (it's not being launched right now, but I have some ideas to fix it...)

## Version 0.0.2

- Syntax definition XML based on Nova JavaScript, using definitions from the old Coda 2 Go mode
- Tried to add Go LPS support
- Added the logo and a few things

## Version 0.0.1

Initial release â€” based on the original Coda 2 Go mode
