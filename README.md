# Go Language Definition for Nova

A quick &amp; dirty Go language definition for the (upcoming) [Panic Nova](https://panic.com/nova) editor.

Tries to use the official (Google-supported) [Go Language Server](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/README.md). It's still in Beta, but, these days, what isn't?

I've just provided the bare minimum to encapsulate the Go LSP (`gopls`) inside a Nova extension. I'm not in the least sure of what I've done!
